## (Un)install arm-none-eabi
Don't use `apt install` as that does not install the [lastest version](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1243252/how-to-install-arm-none-eabi-gdb-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa).

Uninstalling it also requires [additional commands](https://installlion.com/ubuntu/vivid/universe/g/gdb-arm-none-eabi/uninstall/index.html).
